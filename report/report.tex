\section{Introduction}
\section{Budyko Model}
The Budyko model is an energy balance model (EBM) that explores the positive
feedback effect of polar ice cap albedo. The increased reflectivity of polar
ice caps causes Earth to receive less net energy from the sun across these
regions. If a sufficient amount of Earth's surface is covered in ice, 
global temperatures drop and the polar ice caps advance towards the equator.
Conversely, if the ice caps only exist at very high latitudes, then the reduced
reflectivity will cause Earth's temperature to rise, and this ice-line to
recede further.

A number of assumptions are made in order for this EBM to work. Temperature
is modelled as varying only across latitude, reducing the domain of the
system from a spherical surface, to a 1-dimensional temperature profile. In
order to simplify integrals that span the latitudes, the
domain is described using $y = \sin(\varphi)$, where $\varphi$ is latitude.
To simplify the system further, the Earth is treated as an entirely water-based
planet. This allows for the differences in ground reflectivity to be ignored,
focusing only on the albedo of water and ice. The Earth is also modelled as
symmetric across the equator, allowing for only one half of the domain to be
considered, i.e. $y\in [0,1]$. The impact of this last assumption is
investigated in section ----add ref----.

The dynamical equation for temperature consists of three components. They
describe the flow of energy into, out of, and around Earth.
The first of these is incoming solar radiation, insolation.
This depends on the irradiance given out by the sun, as well as the distance
and orientation of the Earth to the sun. This is therefore dependent on the
Milankovitch cycles, namely the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and its axial
tilt (obliquity).

The next component is the outgoing infra-red radiation.
This is approximated to linearly depend on the temperature of Earth. Although
the energy flow occurring within Earth's atmosphere is far more complex, 
empirical data was used to establish the net flow of heat from
Earth to the first order.

The final component of energy flow is the transport of energy around Earth, from
the hot equator to the relatively cooler poles. This depends on the difference
between the average temperature of the earth and the temperature at each
latitude.

Combining these elements gives the dynamical equation for temperature to be

\[
  R\frac{\partial T(y,t)}{\partial t} = \underbrace{Qs(y) (1-\alpha(y,\eta))}_{\text{Insolation}}
  - \underbrace{(A+BT(y,t))}_{\text{Reradiation}}
  + \underbrace{C(\bar{T}-T(y,t))}_{\text{Transport}},
\]

where $A, B, C,$ and $R$ are constants found using empirical data, $Q$ is the
annually averaged solar insolation experienced across the Earth, distributed
according to latitude with the function 

\[
  s(y) = 1+ \frac{1}{2}c_\beta(3y^2-1) 
\]

where $c_\beta = \frac{5}{16}(3\sin^2\beta - 2)$ and $\beta$ is obliquity.

[Here discuss the introduction of the dynamic iceline from widiasih, the
  dynamics of the model, the equilibrium points, the stability, how this
  doesn't get effected by the milankovitch params much at all, the lack of any
  oscillation (which I believe would be impossible anyway given the equations
  formulation), the slow and fast dynamics of the temp and iceline
respectively (as shown in the figure).]
[Also introduce Milankovitch properly and how each orbital parameter is defined
(especially precession). Maybe move Table of orbital params up to milankovitch

\section{Insolation}
To implement an asymmetrical version of the Budyko model, the difference
between the northern and southern hemispheres must first be established. We
will therefore be looking at the variation of insolation over different
latitudes. Insolation is solar irradiance integrated over time, however we are
usually interested in the average insolation over a given time period, hence
the units for both irradiance and average insolation are Wm$^{-2}$. We will
first look at daily average insolation to see how this varies throughout a
year, then a yearly average will be used to investigate long-term changes to
insolation. All simulations that depend on the Milankovitch cycles take this
data from Laskar \cite{milanko_data}.

To model the average insolation over a chosen period, we first express
the irradiance arriving at a given point on Earth, in terms of the orbital
parameters, latitude, and longitude. We will use two frames of reference to
derive this expression. The ``ecliptic frame''
places Earth's orbit in the $x$-$y$ plane with the $x$-axis directed along the
orbit's semi-major axis towards the aphelion (the farthest point from the sun
on Earth's orbit). Using a sun centred coordinate system, we can represent
Earth's position using polar coordinates $\theta$ and $r$. The ``Earth-fixed
frame'' changes with Earth, according to obliquity and precession. With an
Earth centred coordinate system in this frame, we can utilise spherical
coordinates to describe a point on Earth with the unit vector
\[
  \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\varphi\cos\gamma\\\cos\varphi\sin\gamma\\\sin\varphi\end{bmatrix}
\]
which points towards latitude $\varphi$ and longitude $\gamma$ on Earth, hence
$(\varphi,\gamma)$ = $(0,0)$ lies along the positive $x$-axis, whilst the north
pole aligns with the positive $z$-axis.

We now introduce two matrices to describe the rotation of these Earth centred axes,
from the ecliptic frame to the Earth fixed frame. These are
\[
  U_{\beta} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos{\beta} & 0 & \sin{\beta}\\0 & 1 & 0\\-
  \sin{\beta} & 0 & \cos{\beta}\end{bmatrix},\quad\quad
  U_{\rho} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos{\rho} & - \sin{\rho} & 0\\\sin{\rho} &
  \cos{\rho} & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
\]
for obliquity and precession respectively. $U_{\beta}$ acts first,
rotating around the ecliptic $y$-axis, followed by $U_{\rho}$, acting
around the ecliptic $z$-axis.

We now require an expression for irradiance at a given point ($\varphi,\gamma$) given
$\theta, r, \beta,$ and $\rho$. For this we will use an Earth centred
coordinate system in the Earth fixed frame.

Firstly, we express the irradiance at Earth's atmosphere as the total solar
output, $K$, distributed over the surface area of an imagined sphere with a radius
equal to Earth's distance from the sun. This gives
\[
  \frac{K}{4\pi r^2}\,\,\mathrm{Wm^{-2}}.
\]

The irradiance at ($\varphi,\gamma$) is proportional to the cosine of
the angle between $\mathbf{u}$ and the vector that
points from Earth to the sun, $\mathbf{n}$. This vector uses $\theta$, Earth's angle
around the sun in ecliptic polar coordinates, expressed in this frame as
\[
  \mathbf{n} = \left(U_{\rho}U_{\beta}\right)^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}-\cos\theta\\-\sin\theta\\0\end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}-\cos{\beta} \cos(\rho - \theta)\\
  \sin(\rho - \theta)\\-\sin{\beta} \cos(\rho -\theta)\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Multiplying the scalar product of these two unit vectors by the irradiance at
the atmosphere gives
\[
  \begin{split}
    I(r,\theta,\beta,\rho,\varphi,\gamma) &= \frac{K}{4\pi
    r^2}\,\mathbf{u}^\top\mathbf{n}\\
  &=\frac{K}{4\pi r^2}
  \begin{bmatrix}\cos\varphi\cos\gamma\\\cos\varphi\sin\gamma\\\sin\varphi\end{bmatrix}^\top
  \begin{bmatrix}-\cos{\beta} \cos(\rho - \theta)\\
  \sin(\rho - \theta)\\-\sin{\beta} \cos(\rho -\theta)\end{bmatrix}\\
  &= \frac{K}{4\pi r^2}[(\sin{\gamma}\sin{(\rho - \theta)}-\cos{\beta} \cos{\gamma}
    \cos{(\rho-\theta)})\cos{\varphi}
  -\sin{\beta}\sin{\varphi} \cos{(\rho -\theta)}].
\end{split}
\]

Note this expression is only valid for positive values, since the irradiance value
for the dark side of Earth will be negative, when it should be 0. To
calculate the average daily insolation, we can treat the orbital parameters as
constant and integrate over the longitude, $\gamma$. However, since this
expression is only valid for positive values, where the sun is reaching Earth,
we must specify the integration limits to span only this range. To find
these limits in terms of the orbital parameters, we consider a plane passing
through the origin, separating the light and dark hemispheres of Earth,
rotating so that its normal vector always points towards the sun. The plane can
therefore be expressed as
\[
  ax+by+cz=0,
\]
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the components of $\mathbf{n}$.

Next consider a circle of constant latitude $\varphi$, lying parallel to the
$x$-$y$ plane such that
\[
  x^2+y^2 = \cos^2\varphi.
\]
Note this is using a unit sphere for convenience since longitude is
invariant with size.
The intersections of this circle with the plane separating day and night
indicate the limits over which integration should be performed for the given
latitude and orbital parameters. An example of this can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:circ_plane_intercept}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{circ_plane_intercept.pdf}
  \caption{Diagram showing the day-night plane (yellow) that passes through the
    origin at Earth's centre and rotates to face the sun, and the circle of
    constant latitude $\varphi$. The points where the circle intersects the plane
    (green) indicate the range of longitudes for which sunlight will reach Earth
  at latitude $\varphi$ (red) whilst longitudes on the opposite side of the
plane (blue) are in darkness so receive no insolation.}
  \label{fig:circ_plane_intercept}
\end{figure}

Using the final condition that 
\[
  z = \sin\varphi,
\]
we find the two intersection points to be
\[
  \boldsymbol{\mu}_{0,1}=\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}\begin{bmatrix}- a c \sin{\varphi}\mp b
    \sqrt{\left(a^2+b^2\right) \cos^2{\varphi}- c^2 \sin^2{\varphi}}\\
  - b c \sin{\varphi}\pm a \sqrt{\left(a^2+b^2\right) \cos^2{\varphi}
  - c^2 \sin^2{\varphi}}\\
(a^2 + b^2)\sin{\varphi}\end{bmatrix}.\numberthis
\label{eq:integration_limits}
\]

Looking at (\ref{eq:integration_limits}), we see there are two real
solutions when the discriminant, 
\[
  \left(a^2+b^2\right) \cos^2{\varphi} - c^2 \sin^2{\varphi} = \Delta,
\]
is positive.

If $\Delta \le 0$, then there is either no intersection between the circle
and the plane, or only one. Hence the entire circle of latitude $\varphi$ will lie
on the dark, or light, side of the plane.

To determine which side it is, we return to the dot product
$\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}$ where $\mathbf{u}$ points to some part of the
circle and $\mathbf{n}$ points from Earth to the sun. If
$\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}$ is positive then the circle lies entirely within
sunlight, otherwise, darkness. In the rare case that this is exactly equal to
0, a different point on the circle would be chosen.

The intersection points, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_0$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_1$, are
currently expressed in Cartesian coordinates. For the corresponding longitudes
we use the definition $\gamma = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$. We can now
express the longitudinal limits in piecewise form as
\[\gamma_0 = \begin{cases}
    \arctan\left(\frac{\mu_{0y}}{\mu_{0x}}\right), & \Delta>0\\
    0, & \Delta\le 0
  \end{cases},
  \quad\quad\quad
  \gamma_1 = \begin{cases}
    \arctan\left(\frac{\mu_{1y}}{\mu_{1x}}\right), & \Delta>0\\
    2\pi, &\Delta\le 0 \land\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}> 0\\
    0, &\Delta\le 0 \land\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}< 0
  \end{cases},
\]
where the limits become either $[0,2\pi]$ or $[0,0]$ if the given latitude lies
entirely in day or night respectively.

The calculation for daily average insolation is therefore
\[\begin{aligned}
  I_{\mathrm{day}} &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{K}{4\pi
  r^2}\int_{\gamma_0}^{\gamma_1} (\sin{\gamma}\sin{(\rho - \theta)}-\cos{\beta} \cos{\gamma}
    \cos{(\rho-\theta)})\cos{\varphi} -\sin{\beta}\sin{\varphi} \cos{(\rho
    -\theta)}\,\mathrm{d}\gamma\\ 
  &=\frac{K}{8\pi^2r^2}[(\gamma_{0} - \gamma_{1}) \sin{\beta}
  \sin{\varphi} \cos{\left(\rho - \theta \right)} +
  (\sin{\gamma_{0}} \cos{\beta}
  \cos{\left(\rho - \theta \right)} - \sin{\gamma_{1}} \cos{\beta} \cos{\left(\rho - \theta \right)}\\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad + \sin{\left(\rho - \theta \right)} 
\cos{\gamma_{0}} - \sin{\left(\rho - \theta
\right)} \cos{\gamma_{1}} ) \cos{\varphi}].
\end{aligned}
\]
With this expression, we can see how average daily insolation changes
across the globe during a year. Figure \ref{fig:daily_ave_insol_all_lats} shows
how insolation varies over a year across latitudes with current orbital parameters
as well as how it is expected to look 1.0167$\times10^6$ years in the future,
when eccentricity is more extreme. This point in the future was chosen because the
other two orbital parameters, obliquity and precession, are both within 2\% of
present values, allowing us to isolate the impact of eccentricity on the
distribution of insolation.
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Earth's orbital parameters in the year 2000.}
\label{tab:orbital_params}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
  \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Eccentricity ($\varepsilon$)} & 0.0167 &  &  &  \\ \cline{1-2}
  \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Obliquity ($\beta$)}    & 0.4091 radians &  &  &  \\ \cline{1-2}
  \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Precession ($\rho$)}   & 2.9161 radians &  &  &  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

When eccentricity is at its greatest, we can more clearly see the
asymmetry between the hemispheres during their summer solstices. These
occur at 170 and 352 days after aphelion for the southern and northern
hemispheres respectively. The southern hemisphere is shown to experience hotter
summers than the northern hemisphere. This is due to Earth's elliptical orbit
bringing it closer to the sun during the southern summer solstice, with the
perihelion occurring just 12 days later. The reduced distance from the sun
exposes Earth to greater irradiance, which is proportional to $1/r^2$.
Hence we can relate eccentricity to the inequality of the hemisphere's
peak insolation values. However, we will see that eccentricity also
effects the duration for which this insolation is experienced, cancelling out
the effect over a year period.

\ref{tab:orbital_params}, the right plot is how the insolation will be
distributed 1.0167$\times10^6$ years from now. At this time, eccentricity is close to its maximum value at 0.0582,
whilst precession and obliquity are similar to current values.}
  \label{fig:daily_ave_insol_all_lats}
\end{figure}

In order to investigate average yearly insolation over a long period we must
return to the expression for irradiance at a given point,
\[\begin{aligned}
  I &= \frac{K}{4\pi r^2}\mathbf{u}^\top\mathbf{n}\\
    &= \frac{K}{4\pi
    r^2}\begin{bmatrix}\cos\varphi\cos\gamma\\\cos\varphi\sin\gamma\\\sin\varphi\end{bmatrix}^\top
    U_{\beta}^{-1}U_{\rho}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}-\cos\theta\\-\sin\theta\\0\end{bmatrix},
  \end{aligned}
\]
which is only valid for positive values of $I$.

It will be useful to define 
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}\cos\varphi\cos\gamma\\\cos\varphi\sin\gamma\\\sin\varphi\end{bmatrix}^\top
  U_{\beta}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}\sin{\beta} \sin{\varphi } + \cos{\beta}
  \cos{\gamma} \cos{\varphi}\\\sin{\gamma} \cos{\varphi }\\\cos{\beta }\sin{\varphi} - \sin{\beta} \cos{\gamma}
\cos{\varphi} \end{bmatrix}^\top =
  \begin{bmatrix}\cos\hat{\varphi}\cos\hat{\gamma}\\\cos\hat{\varphi}\sin\hat{\gamma}\\\sin\hat{\varphi}\end{bmatrix}^\top,\numberthis
  \label{eq:u_hat_definition}
\]
where $\hat{\varphi}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ can be visualised as the latitude and
longitude measured not from the north pole, but from the $z$-axis in the
ecliptic frame. The irradiance at a given point can therefore be written as
\[
  I = \frac{K}{4\pi r^2}\begin{bmatrix}\cos\hat{\varphi}\cos\hat{\gamma}\\\cos\hat{\varphi}\sin\hat{\gamma}\\\sin\hat{\varphi}\end{bmatrix}^\top 
  \begin{bmatrix} -\cos{\left(\rho - \theta \right)}\\\sin{\left(\rho - \theta
  \right)}\\0\end{bmatrix} = -\frac{K}{4\pi r^2} \cos\hat{\varphi}\cos{\left(\hat{\gamma} + \rho - \theta \right)}
\]
Treating the orbital parameters as fixed, the average insolation over a year
period, $P$, for a given point is
\[
  \bar{I} = \frac{1}{P}\int_0^P\frac{-K}{4\pi r^2}
  \cos\hat{\varphi}\cos{\left(\hat{\gamma} + \rho - \theta
  \right)}\,\mathrm{d}t,\numberthis
  \label{eq:yearly_insol_integral_dt}
\]
however, since $r$ and $\theta$ have a non-linear dependence on time, we shall
use $\theta$ as the variable of integration. Kepler's second law of planetary
motion states
\[
  \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}\theta} = \frac{Pr^2}{2\pi ab},
\]
where $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of Earth's orbit
respectively.

Substituting $\theta$ for $t$ in (\ref{eq:yearly_insol_integral_dt}) now
gives
\begin{align}
    \bar{I} &=\frac{1}{P}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{-K}{4\pi r^2}
    \cos\hat{\varphi}\cos{\left(\hat{\gamma} + \rho - \theta \right)}
    \frac{Pr^2}{2\pi a b}\,\mathrm{d}\theta\nonumber\\ 
    &=\frac{K\cos\hat{\varphi}}{8\pi^2
    a b}\int_0^{2\pi}-\cos{\left(\hat{\gamma} + \rho - \theta \right)}
    \,\mathrm{d}\theta.\label{eq:yearly_insol}
\end{align}
Recall that the expression for $I$ is only valid for positive values, staying
at 0 for negative values. Hence the integral in (\ref{eq:yearly_insol})
evaluates to 2, giving the average yearly insolation to be
\[
  \bar{I} = \frac{K\cos\hat{\varphi}}{4\pi^2 a b}.
\]
Note that this no longer depends upon precession. This is as a result of the
symmetry in the effect of precession over a full orbit.

In order to attain an expression for average yearly insolation for just a given
latitude, we must also average over all longitudes. It will be of more use to
express this in the Earth-fixed frame, using the conventional latitude values.
For this we refer to (\ref{eq:u_hat_definition}), which defines
\[
  \sin{\hat{\varphi}} = \cos{\beta}\sin{\varphi} -
  \sin{\beta}\cos{\gamma}\cos{\varphi},
\]
hence
\[
  \bar{I} = \frac{K\sqrt{1 -\left( \cos{\beta}\sin{\varphi} -
  \sin{\beta}\cos{\gamma}\cos{\varphi}\right)^2}}{4\pi^2 a b}.
\]

We now average this over longitude to get
\[
  \frac{K}{4\pi^2 a b}\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi}\sqrt{1 -\left( \cos{\beta}\sin{\varphi} -
  \sin{\beta}\cos{\gamma}\cos{\varphi}\right)^2}\,\mathrm{d}\gamma.
\]

In order to express this purely as a function of orbital parameters and
latitude, we use the relation $b = a\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}$, where
$\varepsilon$ is orbital eccentricity. Further, we know that Earth's semi-major
axis, $a$, remains essentially constant regardless of orbital parameters
\cite{milanko_data}. This gives the average yearly insolation for a given
latitude to be
\[
  I_{\mathrm{year}}(\beta,\varepsilon,\varphi) = \frac{K}{8\pi^3 a^2 \sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}}\int_0^{2\pi}\sqrt{1 -\left( \cos{\beta}\sin{\varphi} -
  \sin{\beta}\cos{\gamma}\cos{\varphi}\right)^2}\,\mathrm{d}\gamma.
\]

Importantly, this expression is even in $\varphi$, meaning that yearly
insolation is symmetric over the north and south hemispheres. This can be seen
in Figure \ref{fig:yearly_ave_insol_present} which uses current orbital
parameters as shown in Table \ref{tab:orbital_params}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{yearly_average_insol_present.pdf}
  \caption{The average yearly insolation for current orbital parameters, as
    shown in Table \ref{tab:orbital_params}. This is symmetric about 0$^\circ$,
    meaning that over a year period, both hemispheres receive the same amount
  of insolation.}
  \label{fig:yearly_ave_insol_present}
\end{figure}
This may appear counter-intuitive at first given the difference in distance,
and therefore irradiance, that the two hemispheres experience, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:daily_ave_insol_all_lats}. When looking at the plot with higher
eccentricity, we see the south hemisphere experiences significantly higher
maximum irradiance levels than the north. However, what is less clear from this
plot, is how long each hemisphere's summer solstice lasts.

Figure \ref{fig:orbital_angles} shows Earth's orbit around the sun, with
exaggerated eccentricity. The position of the equinoxes and solstices are
governed by Earth's precession, $\rho$, which causes them to rotate around the
orbit in an anticlockwise direction. The precession shown here is similar to
the precession at present, causing the summer solstice in the northern
hemisphere to occur a little before aphelion. 

From Kepler's second law, we know that
\[
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{2\pi a b}{Pr^2},
\]
where $P$ is the year period, and $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor
axes respectively. On the scale of a year these are constant, meaning
Earth's angular speed around the sun is proportional to $1/r^2$.

This means that in the case of Figure \ref{fig:orbital_angles}, the summer
period, ranging from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, lasts
significantly longer than the winter period, ranging from the winter solstice
to the vernal equinox. 

Recall that the irradiance that reaches Earth's atmosphere is $\frac{K}{4\pi
r^2}$, which is also proportional to $1/r^2$. Integrating the irradiance
over the summer period gives
\[
  Q = \int_{t(\theta_{\mathrm{S}})}^{t(\theta_{\mathrm{S}}+\frac{\pi}{2})}
  \frac{K}{4\pi r^2}\, \mathrm{d}t,
\]
where $t(\theta)$ is the time that corresponds to orbital angle $\theta$.

Changing the variable of integration to $\theta$ we obtain
\[\begin{aligned}
  Q &=
  \int_{\theta_{\mathrm{S}}}^{\theta_{\mathrm{S}}+\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{K}{4\pi
  r^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}\theta}\,\mathrm{d}\theta\\
  &=\int_{\theta_{\mathrm{S}}}^{\theta_{\mathrm{S}}+\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{K}{4\pi r^2}\frac{Pr^2}{2\pi
  a b}\,\mathrm{d}\theta\\
  &=\frac{KP}{8\pi^2 a b}\int_{\theta_{\mathrm{S}}}^{\theta_{\mathrm{S}}+\frac{\pi}{2}} 1
  \,\mathrm{d}\theta.
\end{aligned}
\]
